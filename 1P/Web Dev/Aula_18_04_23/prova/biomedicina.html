                In today's episode, strange physical reactions have started to emerge in the local population after a strange substance contaminated the city's water. This could be a scene from a science fiction movie or just another day in the routine of someone who graduated from a Biomedicine college, committed to discovering what is affecting people's health and how to treat them.
                <br><br>
                Everything that involves and falls within the competence of the biomedical professional:
                <br><br>
                Clinical and toxicological analysis;<br>
                Blood and stem cell banks;<br>
                Molecular biology;<br>
                Molecular oncology;<br>
                Imaging analysis;<br>
                Environmental analysis;<br>
                Bromatology;<br>
                Assisted human reproduction;<br>
                Genetics;<br>
                Production and analysis of bio-derived products;<br>
                Bioengineering;<br>
                Public health.<br>
                <br>
                This is not fiction, it is pure reality! At Unifran, you will have a modern Biomedicine course with a pedagogical plan that promotes a technical-generalist education.
                <br>
                The Biomedicine curriculum provides practical classes in advanced laboratories, while being humanistic, guided by high standards of quality and ethical principles.
                <br>
                Duration of the course
                <br>
                A Biomedicine course lasts for eight (8) semesters, which is equivalent to four (4) years of studies. During the study period, specific practices of the professional's daily life, such as basic health care, Biosafety and Collection Techniques, will be available.
                <br>
                The Biomedicine course is aimed at understanding the causes, consequences, and symptoms of diseases that affect the health of the population. It is an area that becomes responsible for developing mechanisms to achieve diagnoses, as well as improving treatments.
                <br>
                It can also work in the following areas:
                <br><br>

                Toxicology.<br>
                <br>
                Distinguishing Features of Biomedicine College
                <br>
                The Biomedicine undergraduate program has a pedagogical project that is constantly updated, which contributes to the profile of education within the expectations of the job market, attentive to the latest research trends.
                <br>
                The highly qualified faculty, composed of masters and doctors, provides a solid theoretical foundation and modern and well-equipped didactic laboratory facilities, in which theory and practice are perfectly integrated.
                <br>
                The interaction of students with the community occurs in some Biomedicine subjects from the beginning of the course. For example, in the Clinical Analysis Laboratory, laboratory services are provided to the population.
                <br>
                And if you're wondering what Biomedicine studies, know that among the courses offered are:
                <br><br>
                Human Genetics;<br>
                Clinical Bacteriology;<br>
                Aesthetic Biomedicine.<br>
